## Abstract
This research investigates applicability of image-based analysis to quantify and classify porosities in greyscale scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, made from polished cement samples. Within the past decades, mercury intrusion porosimeter (MIP) technique has been proposed to measure pore volume fraction is cement-based matrices. However, MIP method was found to overestimate porosity as this method is incapable of quantifying disconnected pores. Therefore, it is of interest to determine whether image analysis coupled with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) could characterize porosity. Accordingly, images pre-analyzed by ImageJ commercial software are used to calibrate the python code. The calibrated model was then subject to Exploratory Data Analysis, for feature engineering used for machine learning. And the extracted features, which are likely to be predictive of porosity are used to train the employed machine learning models. Results of the present study revealed a strong correlation exists between chemistry of cement hydrates and pore volume fraction. In addition, the shape of pores are found to be affected by porosity.
