Althought, images were classified with a reasonable accuracy. This works is not that complex, but it serves as the base model in this field. As it was mentioned in the previous sections, other physiochemical properties could be identified. 

The models in this project will be developed and used for other projects. We will collect more labeled data and we will be willing to create a model that will be able to predict the remaining life service of any structural element based on pore system characteristcs, and the chemical compositions.
