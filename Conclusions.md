## Conclusions

Based on the present machine learning analysis, the following conclusions could be drawn: 

* ANN was found to be capable of predicting porosity in cement paste matrix by leveraging chemistry of hydrates as well as angularity of pores. 
* The results of ANN revealed that an increase in concentration of C-S-H gel and C-H in cement would probably enhance matrix densification, consequently reducing pore volume fraction locally.
* By doing ANN, it was proved that chemistry of cement alone has the ability to predict porosity of cement with almost 80% accuracy. However, if the physical properties of pores, e.g. angularity, is coupled with cement chemistry, this accuracy would be reduced to 70%.
* CNN is determined to be a powerful technique for classification of porosities based on their volume fraction in SEM images.
* Although the number of input data was limited to 200 SEM images, decent accuracy was achieved using both ANN and CNN. Therefore, a limited number of input data (which is dictated by the difficulty and high cost of imaging) may have little impact on the robustness of both ANN and CNN.
