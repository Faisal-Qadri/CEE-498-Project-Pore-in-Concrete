## Conclusions
### Based on the present machine learning analysis, the following conclusions could be drawn: 

*  Machine learning algorithm is capable of predicting porosity in cement paste matrix by leveraging chemistry of hydrates as well as angularity of pores. 
* The results of Neural Network revealed that the increase in concenteration of C-S-H gel and C-H in cement would probably enhance matrix densification, therefore pore volume fraction would be locally decreased.
* By doing Neural Network analysis, chemistry of cement itself has the ability to predict porosity of cement with almost 80% accuracy. However, if the physical property of pores (i.e. angularity) is coupled with the cement chemistry, this accuracy would be reduced to 70%.
* Although the number of input data was limited to 200 SEM images, decent accuracy was achieved. This suggests that the limited number of input data (which is dictated by the difficulty and high cost of imaging) may have little impact on the rebustness of Neural Network.
